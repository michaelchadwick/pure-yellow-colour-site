  <h1>about</h1>

  <p>Pure Yellow Colour is an indie acoustic rock band from San Diego, CA. We've been informally playing together since April of 2006, but formally since July.</p>

  <p>Mike ("Pure Yel") plays lead guitar and Kathy ("Low Colour") plays rhythm guitar and sings. Together, we create a musical miasma of melancholic magnitude.</p>

  <p>We currently have our first album available for purchase on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Primary/dp/B001AI0VO6/ref=dmusic_cd_album?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1218138665&amp;sr=8-3">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=279571887&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a>, and other fine online retailers. You can stream us on <a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a>, too.</p>

  <p>We may be in other places, too, so search for Pure Yellow Colour wherever fine acoustic pop music is sold/streamed!</p>
