        <strong>Adamant</strong><br /><br />

        none but shining hours you are swift to break<br />
        i'm holding on to nothing, this thing<br />
        holding on<br /><br />

        adamant<br />
        adamant<br />
        adamant<br />
        holding on<br /><br />

        i wait, i crave the start of us<br />
        i creep, i crave the start of us<br />
        none but shining hours i am swift to take<br /><br />

        adamant<br />
        adamant<br />
        adamant<br />
        holding on<br /><br />

        <strong>Barnstormer</strong><br /><br />

        we took our morning coffee<br />
        with idle conversation<br />
        and stolen sugar packets<br />
        and half and half<br />
        and i fancied me a barnstormer<br />
        out on your wing<br />
        are you even listening?<br />
        are you even listening?<br />
        and i fancied us lovers, once<br />
        i've only left to fall<br />
        broken heart and all<br /><br />

        with you, every silence is a song<br />
        and you could make no solemn vow<br />
        and every breath i take is wrong<br />
        still filled with longing<br />
        turn me upside down<br />
        and i fancy me a barnstormer<br />
        out on your wing<br />
        are you even listening?<br /><br />

        when i wake, i am craving salt<br />
        sweet sweat you never bring<br />
        love me, love, so it's not my fault<br />
        downwards i'm spiralling<br /><br />

        and i fancied us lovers, once<br />
        i've only left to fall<br />
        broken heart and all<br /><br />

        <strong>Can't Sleep</strong><br /><br />

        we raced up that hill<br />
        fast as we can<br />
        mud on our shins and eleven again<br /><br />

        hard is the fall<br />
        tumbling down<br />
        with love as plain as the stain<br />
        on the sheets of your bed<br />
        rose red blood<br />
        we're not eleven at all<br />
        I still feel very small<br />
        beneath the crush of your chest<br />
        while you sleep<br />
        I can't sleep<br />
        while you sleep<br />
        I can't sleep<br /><br />

        to you, it's nothing at all<br />
        it's like nothing at all<br />
        it's like nothing at all<br /><br />

        I keep wishing too hard to find spring again<br />
        but you're only a man, you're only a man<br /><br />

        to you, it's nothing at all<br />
        it's like nothing at all<br />
        pushing my buttons<br />
        and love in the oven<br />
        my sheets in a twist<br />
        and my heart's in a knot<br />
        and I'm twisting my hands<br />
        but you're only a man<br />
        you complicate me<br />
        and I can't sleep<br /><br />

        <strong>Drift</strong><br /><br />

        i had long said goodbye<br />
              but went undressing wounds<br />
              that had been bandaged by time<br />
              they said you were the same<br />
              you could always make me smile<br />
              did your thoughts cross on my name?<br /><br />

              or did that, like every other thing, turn to dust?<br />
              or did that, like every other thing, shift like sand?<br /><br />

              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              always slipping through our hands<br />
              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              drifting back into the sea<br />
              you didn't drift back home to me<br />
              will you ever drift back home to me?<br /><br />

              i would wake to your sigh<br />
              or your laughter on the wind<br />
              i could be chasing ghosts again<br />
              i can dream you in the tide<br />
              the salt in the sea<br />
              ever stinging where we bleed<br /><br />

              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              always slipping through our hands<br />
              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              drifting back into the sea<br />
              you could always drift back home to me<br />
              you could always drift back home to me<br /><br />

              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              always slipping through our hands<br />
              a fine fine grain among a hundred thousand<br />
              drifting back into the sea<br /><br />

              you could always drift back home to me<br />
              you could always drift back home to me<br />
              you could always drift back home to me<br />
              you could always drift back home to me<br /><br />

        <strong>Intension</strong><br /><br />

              easy does the heartstring slip through your hands<br />
              mine are shaking with a fever<br />
              desperate to undo the knots that you made<br />
              poor attempt to set the thread straight<br /><br />

              i would keep the lights<br />
              turned on at the sides<br />
              try to stare the night down<br /><br />

              with my shoulders tight, back<br />
              eyes wide<br />
              face front<br />
              all your gravity did need<br />
              to wreak havoc on my fact<br />
              is a look<br />
              and my physics shook<br />
              and my physics shook<br /><br />

              with a gift of vulgar poetry i came<br />
              parting my knees for you<br />
              seeking something somewhat estuarial<br />
              if you would only disembogue<br />
              if i could only find some words when you are near<br />
              if i could only keep myself from disappearing<br />
              if i could only hold my ground<br />
              i'm blown so petaline<br /><br />

        <strong>Lather Rinse Repeat</strong><br /><br />

        oh here we go again<br />
              don't you tire of these games?<br />
              afraid my heart is sinking in<br />
              the sand of your quick<br /><br />

              don't put all the blame on me<br />
              and act as if it's not your fault<br />
              when every time we say it's done<br />
              you come running back<br /><br />

              you make me fall apart<br />
              to pick the pieces up again<br />
              a fragment of my heart<br />
              is lost in every rise<br />
              to your eyes<br /><br />

              and i know, and i know i should stay away<br />
              but that would make your life too easy<br />
              and i bend and you bend and we try to break<br /><br />

        you make me fall apart<br />
              to pick the pieces up again<br />
              a fragment of my heart<br />
              is lost in every rise<br />
              to your eyes<br /><br />

              and i know, and i know i should stay away<br />
              but that would make your life to easy<br />
              and i bend and you bend and we try to break<br />
              but we just can't break<br /><br />

        <strong>Mood</strong> (written by Mike)<br /><br />

        it puts me in a mood that im out of<br />
              one i cant shout of<br />
              for all of my life<br />
              and it puts me in a mood im not proud of<br />
              lets start the countdown<br />
              to the rest of my life<br /><br />

              outside in a haunted room<br />
              I think it's a smile<br />
              fourteen years of a loveless life<br />
              and it ended by her morning light<br /><br />

              we're spending hours alone on a quiet night<br />
              but I still feel we're together when it gets bright<br /><br />

              and it puts me in a mood that im out of<br />
              one i cant shout of<br />
              for all of my life<br />
              and it puts me in a mood im not proud of<br />
              lets start the countdown<br />
              to the rest of my life<br /><br />

              i cant drive fast enough to<br />
              bring about the change that I want<br />
              shallow is the game that we play<br />
              but what I need is miles away<br /><br />

              a thousand stars will be my guide tonight<br />
              i hope i see you tomorrow by daylight<br /><br />

              rest your head on a pillow<br />
              muffle the noise with your sleep<br />
              the hotel room, it was different<br />
              we could talk through my teeth<br /><br />

        and it puts me in a mood that im out of<br />
              one i cant shout of<br />
              for all of my life<br />
              and it puts me in a mood im not proud of<br />
              lets start the countdown<br />
              to the rest of my life<br /><br />

              and it puts me in a mood that im out of<br />
              all of the feelings<br />
              im empty of tonight<br />
              and it puts me in a mood that i doubt will<br />
              cancel the doubt you'll<br />
              hang up tonight<br /><br />

              and it puts me in a mood that im out of<br />
              one i cant shout of<br />
              for all of my life<br />
              and it puts me in a mood im not proud of<br />
              lets start the countdown<br />
              to the rest of my life<br /><br />

        <strong>Pens and Knives</strong><br /><br />

            i could drown in alcohol<br />
              and pass out in a stranger's bed<br />
              but it wouldn't be my style<br />
              i could take a sleeping pill<br />
              and dream of nothing but blue<br />
              a hue tainted with you<br /><br />

              pens and knives<br />
              i carve another thought<br />
              you try to ink with iodine<br />
              i'll be all right<br />
              your antiseptic stings a little<br />
              blame it all on pens and knives<br /><br />

        <strong>Revolver Unloaded</strong><br /><br />

        cigarettes and broken glass<br />
              shallow breaths and bleeding hands<br />
              cut up from the trip<br />
              enjoy the view from where you stand<br />
              i find it hard not to pretend<br />
              this isn't it<br /><br />

              i'm waiting<br />
              you're aiming<br />

              we talk around the subject much<br />
              but never really touch the point at hand<br />
              doubling back, go half a step<br />
              a half a step, a half a step<br />
              but are we any closer to the end?<br /><br />

              i'm waiting<br />
              you're aiming<br />
              your loaded gun<br />
              i'm waiting<br />
              you're aiming<br />
              your loaded gun<br /><br />

              if i manage to rise<br />

              am i compromised?<br /><br />

        <strong>Six More Weeks of Winter</strong><br /><br />

        frostbit lips you never kiss<br />
              oh, how is this that we're freezing indoors?<br />
              thought this was san diego<br />
              you fall asleep beside me<br />
              i could hold you close<br />
              but i need to learn the finer art of being cold<br />
              the finer art of letting go<br /><br />

              are we defined by tv shows?<br />
              the morning news breaks the quiet of your room<br />
              but i would rather watch the soaps<br />
              are we defined by radios?<br />
              you like my taste in music<br />
              and that's about where we begin and end<br />
              the line that ties us both as friends<br /><br />

              i'd never thought i'd see the snow<br />
              but i never thought i could burn so cold<br />
              for you without a reason why<br />
              another lazy afternoon<br />
              spent in sterile silence, next to you<br />
              your winter turns my world to white<br />
              what would it take to change your mind?<br /><br />

        <strong>Tug of War</strong><br /><br />

        boy if you're yanking my chain<br />
              i would appreciate another pull<br />
              no finer feeling so false<br />
              comes close to breaking my golden rule<br /><br />

              don't fall in love<br />
              always be sure to leave hearts in the dust<br />
              leave the boy in the mud<br />
              this game was fun<br />
              thought for a minute there that it could last<br />
              but the chain come undone<br />
              and where you end and i begin<br />
              is as clear as the sun<br /><br />

              boy if you're yanking my chain<br />
              whoever told you that this was cool?<br />
              you played a little too nice<br />
              i let my guard down<br />
              though i hike my skirt up my thigh<br />
              won't keep it clean<br />
              you like it dirty dirty dirty<br />
              and secretly<br />
              i do agree<br />
              and when the wind changed<br />
              i got a hard spray<br />
              a lesson i need<br /><br />

              don't fall in love with feelings so fast<br />
              unstable footing, a face in the sand<br />
              boy you leave me for dust<br />
              and then you come back<br />
              and you help me up<br />
              held my hand<br />
              tell me something<br />
              was this all in your plan?<br />
              i think that you must know something i don't<br />
              if this isn't lust, is this love?<br />
              do i trust you to come back?<br />
              and all the heartache<br />
              you're passing my way<br />
              is something i need<br /><br />

        <strong>You Forget About Me</strong><br /><br />

        well you say that you just want to be friends<br />
              and i guess that i could understand that<br />
              so i buried my heart under your tree<br />
              but it still don't stop the beat<br />
              no it still don't stop the beat<br />
              when you forget about me<br /><br />

              you are taking root on the inside<br />
              and you don't even know what you squeeze<br />
              i'm still weak in the knees<br />
              i'm always pleased to see you but oh<br />
              oh, i said oh<br />
              how you forget about me<br />
              how you forget about me<br /><br />

              i'm taking my time<br />
              so i'm sure i'll be fine<br />
              but i'm losing my head<br />
              when you're changing your mind<br />
              i was head over heels<br />
              but now i'm just down, down, down<br />
              down down baby down down your rollercoaster<br />
              sweet sweet baby i'll never let you go<br />
              i wanna let you go<br />
              but i can't let you go<br />
              though you forget about me<br /><br />

              forget about forget about forget about it!<br />
              no, i don't want to play<br />
              i lost my heart<br />
              like a game of cards<br />
              not poker, just old maid<br />
              that's what i get for wearing my heart on my sleeve<br />
              boy, you can tell me that you never meant to deceive<br />
              but it still don't stop the hurt<br /><br />

              forget about forget about forget about it!<br />
              no, i don't want to play<br />
              if i agree, it won't guarantee<br />
              that with me you'll choose to stay<br /><br />

              and i have changed my mind<br />
              so many times<br />
              i've called you up<br />
              to read between the lines<br />
              but i can't hide behind a bluff<br />
              and i have lost enough<br /><br />

              that's what i get<br />
              for wearing it out on my sleeve<br />
              boy, you can tell me that you never meant to deceive<br />
              but it still don't stop the hurt<br />
              no, it still don't stop the hurt<br />
