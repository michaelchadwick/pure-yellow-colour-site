<h3>One Last Time, For Posterity</h3>
<p><strong>(10/23/13):</strong>
<a href="http://pureyellow.net">Pureyellow.net</a> is no more.

<p>The domain finally ran out and stopped resolving recently. While the band, uh, disbanded years ago, the domain name lived on, just in case. Well, this post is largely to put the kibosh on that because the pretense is no longer worth keeping up. No new music will be produced, and the Rock Band Network tracks never made it past the first round of testing, but I wouldn't have missed out on any of it.</p>

<p><a href="http://pyc.nebyoolae.com">Pure Yellow Colour</a> was an amazing experience for me, <a href="http://nebyoolae.com">Mike</a>, a.k.a. the one who has made all these news posts over the years. Of all the musical projects I've embarked on thus far in life, it felt like the most legitimate. It was a great collaboration with <a href="http://faintidea.net">Kathy</a> where I learned a lot about myself and the kind of music I want to make.</p>

<p>PYC was the impetus to finally play music I had a hand in making in front of an audience.<br />
<p>PYC was the impetus to ask people to <em>actually pay</em> to see me play music.<br />
<p>PYC gave me the confidence to say, officially, that <strong>I'm a musician</strong> (even if I don't make my living from it).</p>

<p>Over the course of its existence (5+ years), our one album, <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=279571887&s=143441">Primary</a>, has netted us a cool <strong>$82.32</strong> between iTunes, Spotify, and a few other online sources. It ain't much, but it ain't nothing.</p>

<p>For all of those who listened, came to an open-mic or show, or commented on PYC, I thank you. Hope you enjoy(ed) the music, and farewell.</p>

<h3>Rock Band Network is On Hold Again</h3>
<p><strong>(01/14/11):</strong> Happy New Year!

While it was exciting to get two PYC songs put up on RBN for some testing many months ago, only one got even a single review. That's not even close to enough to move it to the next level of Peer Review, so the journey to getting on the RBN Marketplace is still just beginning. Thankfully, the review that <em>was</em> received was a good one, chock full o' stuff to update before resubmitting for more testing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (but kind of fortunately), RBN 2.0 is now out, which means drums can be <strong>Pro Drums</strong>, but also means more delays. It's been a long road and the steam needed to get this project done is currently at a low, but it will come back at some point.</p>

<p>In the meantime, tide yourself over with an <a href="music/singles/pyc-no_rain.mp3">old cover</a> we did of Blind Melon's hit single <em>No Rain</em>. I think we did a fairly good job, despite the recording being raw and undeveloped.</p>

<h3>Rock Band Network: Update, New (Old) Track</h3>
<p><strong>(09/28/10):</strong> So, it took a little longer than anticipated to actually get around to finishing up the songs for the <a href="http://creators.rockband.com">Rock Band Network</a> (man, it's been 10 <em>months</em>), but they are now available for playtesting over the following two weeks. If you are a member of RBN and have the ability to playtest either "Pens and Knives" or "Six More Weeks of Winter", we would be muchly appreciative. They're both first attempts at tracking PYC's music, so they probably have some issues. Thus, we need the community to help us get them on RBN!</p>

<p>We recently finished a new (old) track, called "<a href="music/singles/pyc-revolver_unloaded.mp3">Revolver Unloaded</a>". Originally a short instrumental by Mike, Kathy provided some vocals and a new song was born. It's a bit long in running time, but the mood it creates is easy to get lost in.</p>

<h3>Rock Band Network</h3>
<p><strong>(11/18/09):</strong> Rock Band, that awesome rock star simulation you all know and love, will soon be letting bands sell their own DLC in the Music Store, courtesy of <a href="http://creators.rockband.com">Rock Band Network</a>. The tools to make the custom MIDI instructions to make this possible were released a while ago, but the store isn't accepting submissions yet. "Six More Weeks of Winter" is already in the final stages of production as Pure Yellow Colour's first entry into the RBN. Look for it soon!</p>

<p>Also, a mobile stylesheet has been created for pureyellow.net. Visit the site with an iPhone to check it out.</p>

<h3>PYC @ AmazonMP3</h3>
<p><strong>(02/13/09):</strong> Pure Yellow Colour is on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Primary/dp/B001AI0VO6/ref=dmusic_cd_album?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1218138665&amp;sr=8-3">Amazon</a>! Actually, we've been on Amazon for a while, but I just got around to cleaning up the code for the site and wanted to make that apparent to anyone still coming here.</p>

<h3>PYC @ iTunes</h3>
<p><strong>(04/29/08):</strong> Pure Yellow Colour is on <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=279571887&amp;s=143441">iTunes</a>! We're also gonna be on some other digital music distributor websites soon, too, but freakin' iTunes, man! Legitimacy has never tasted this sweet before.</p>

<h3><em>Primary</em> Released</h3>
<p><strong>(04/09/08):</strong> Pure Yellow Colour's first album, <em>Primary</em>, is now available for purchase on <a href="http://cdbaby.com/cd/pureyellowcolour">CD Baby</a>. We've heard good things about them and it's always good to support musicians so we can afford to make more music, so go on over and check it out!</p>

<p><strong>(12/21/07):</strong> An early Christmas present to all of our fans (if there are any left at this point): our first album, <a href="primary.php">Primary</a>, is done and available for download! OMFG!</p>

<p><strong>(12/05/07):</strong> I don't want to sound apocryphal or anything, but <em>for now</em> PYC as a gigging and recording band is pretty dead.  This is not to say that we won't ever produce anything ever again, or that we'll never perform in public together (we actually have a far-off
performance date we still need to keep), as the future is always unwritten.  What this means is that as a visitor to this site, don't look for anything new anytime soon in terms of music or show information.</p>

<p>To completely contradict that statement just for fun's sake, the show we did at the E Street Cafe back in April 07 is <a
href="music/shows/estreet/">now available</a> to download.</p>

<p>On the other hand, The Album, as we've referred to it in the past, may or may not see the light of day.  If it does, it'll be available for
download just like the live shows, hopefully with some digital CD jewel case artwork you can print out to look at while you listen to the digital audio.</p>

<p><strong>(10/10/07):</strong> Yes, it's been nearly 3 months since we've last updated the site.  Work on the album came to a standstill again because of no studio monitors to properly mix it on.  Well, both Kathy and I have moved into a new house with two others and studio monitors have
been purchased and set up.  Now to find the time to work on things!</p>

<p>We've also begun performing at a new open-mic closer to our new digs. The Hot Java Cafe in the Carmel Mountain region of San Diego is the
spot, so check us out on Thursdays and/or Saturdays from anywhere between 8pm and 10pm.</p>

<p><strong>(07/18/07):</strong> Practically all the recording has been done for the new album, so it's down to mixing.  Agonizingly, but probably not surprising, this part of the album seemingly takes forever since the raw tracks sound different on each system we listen to it on.  It's sort of
like making a website and trying to get it to display the same way in each browser. Maddening.</p>

<p><strong>(06/12/07):</strong> The album is nearing completion, as the songs needing to be recorded dwindles down.  The halfway point has probably been reached and surpassed by now, so the end is definitely near.  We'll be having a CD-release party of some sort, so be sure to come check that out when it's announced.</p>

<p><strong>(05/29/07):</strong> Album progress continues!  Two songs are pretty close to done, a third is nearing completion, and two more are in the early stages of sequencing.</p>

<p>The <a href="music.php">music</a> page has been updated to showcase our new live show, recently uploaded.  It's our show from 02-02-2007 at the Twiggs (now defunct) Green Room.  It was our first real "show" in that we had billing on the chalkboard outside and got to play all of the songs (at that point) we'd written together.  Lots of people showed up and it was pretty freaking awesome.  If anyone didn't get to come out or just wants to hear it again, go download it!</p>

<p>The <a href="liveshows.php">live shows</a> page has been updated a bit, too.</p>

<p><strong>(05/18/07):</strong> It's been a slow month for the band, what with no shows and a spare open-mic here and there.  In the background, our first full-length album is being recorded.  We just finished doing the initial
recordings for track 1, "Drift," last night and it's sounding like the best stuff we've ever put down on MP3 so far.  It's gonna be a shock to hear the formula of guitar+vox expanded into a full-on band. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><strong>(04/10/07):</strong> A <a href="liveshows.php">live show</a> page has been added to keep track of all of the gigs we do.  You can check it out to see what songs we've played and where we've played them so far in our
illustrious and storied history.  It will be updated with upcoming concert dates and setlists as they occur.</p>

<p>Also, a text navigation strip at the bottom of each page has been added for people who don't use images (does anyone actually do that?) or want to click to a new page once you've hit the bottom of one and don't want to scroll (we know your pain).</p>

<p><strong>(04/09/07):</strong> A <a href="lyrics.php">lyrics page</a> has been added as an addendum to the music section of our website.  All of the songs in our current live performance rotation are listed there.</p>

<p><strong>(04/07/07):</strong> 80+ minutes of Pure Yellow Colour was delivered to the E Street Cafe last Friday, and the verdict is in: we play music on a level equal to something that is good!  Thanks to everyone who came out to check us out, friends and strangers alike.  It was quite a harrowing experience to play such a marathon, but we'll probably do it again in a couple months, so if you missed it you can still check us out then.</p>

<p>For now, it's back to open-mics at Lestat's on Mondays and/or E Street Cafe on Tuesdays, so if you got some time and an itchy listening ear, be sure to be there.</p>

<p><strong>(03/27/07):</strong> A new coffee shop open-mic has been breached! We settled down for a rousing 2-song set at the <a href="http://estreetcafe.com">E Street Cafe</a> in Encinitas last night. Apparently, we did well enough to get asked to play a regular gig of our own, and that will be coming up on April 6th from 8:00-9:30pm.  This is our longest show yet, so you'll probably get to hear all of the songs we've written so far.  Be there or be quadrilateralistic.</p>

<p>Also, there is a new mp3 up on our <a href="music.php">music page</a>. It's called "Pens and Knives," and the lyrics were partly influenced by a dream of Kathy's.  Pretty keen!</p>

<p><strong>(03/23/07):</strong> Pure Yellow Colour's second show at Twiggs's makeshift venue in a massage parlor went off without a movie starring Will Smith.  Maybe our sound levels were a little off, but singing about
grasshoppers makes everything all right.  Thank you to everyone who came out, as we always appreciate it. We'll be playing Lestat's Open-Mic this coming Monday, as usual, but also auditioning at the <a href="http://estreetcafe.com/">E Street Cafe</a> open-mic in Encinitas the day after. Zazzy!</p>

<p><strong>(03/12/07):</strong> Good news!  Our Twiggs show that was thought to be canceled has been resuscitated via magic and consternation.  Once again, it is on March 16th, 9pm, at Twiggs, except actually across the street at an alternate venue (Mueller College of Holistic Studies, 4601 Park Blvd). Come one, come all, to see our second-ever show...ever!</p>

<p><strong>(03/05/07):</strong> Unfortunately, we are no longer playing Twiggs on March 16th because they have decided to finally honor a "no live music" clause in their lease and have canceled all future shows.  We're
currently searching for a new venue to showcase our AWESOME MUSICAL MIGHT but as of yet are empty-handed.  Stay tuned.</p>

<p><strong>(02/23/07):</strong> PureYellow.Net v1.0 is now officially online! Our makeshift site has been reborne unto a shell more visually pleasing and with fancy-pants CSS that will surely fall apart in any browser version
older than a couple years.</p>

<p>The biggest addition is the <a href="gallery.php">gallery page</a> where we'll be putting up PYC-related imagery when we feel like it. The <a href="music.php">music</a> page is still bereft of anything but <a
href="music/singles/pyc-cant_sleep.mp3">Can't Sleep</a>, but we're working hard on getting more of our music up in recorded format. The best way to hear our stuff right now is still to come to one of our live shows, which can most easily be accomplished by coming to <a href="http://twiggs.org">Twiggs</a> on March 16th, as we will be playing there around 9:20pm. How much more convenient can you get?</p>

<p><strong>(02/07/07):</strong> Our next gig will once again be at Twiggs, and it will once again be on an <a href="http://www.sainturho.com">esoteric holiday</a>. Come out to see us gently rock in a manner unbecoming of youth on March 16th at 9:30pm. Also, bring grasshoppers.</p>

<p><strong>(02/03/07):</strong> Pure Yellow Colour's first gig was a success. Thank you to everyone who came out to support us. It's a dream come true. <a href="img/gallery/big/pyc20070202.jpg">PICTURE</a>!</p>

<p><strong>(01/04/07):</strong> PYC has a real-life, actual gig to play! Join us on Friday, February 2nd at <a href="http://www.twiggs.org">Twiggs Bakery and Coffeeshop</a> in the San Diego, CA area at 9:30pm for our first feature-length show (~40 minutes). Cover is $10.</p>

<p><strong>(01/02/07):</strong> PYC had a successful evening of recording on New Year's Eve, netting five official original drafts. As soon as we do some listening, mixing, and extra recording, we should have "final" versions
of our songs to post here. Go go Firepod!</p>

<p><strong>(12/19/06):</strong> Dos mas pel&iacute;culas can be found on El YouTube, piping hot from our recent performance at Lestat's West open-mic stint. We rocked out one PYC original, <em>Lather Rinse Repeat</em>, as well as a special holiday tune (thanks to Robyn for the awesome signing!), since it is the season for that kind of thing.</p>

<p><strong>(12/15/06):</strong> 2 new moving picture tapes are available on YouTube, fresh from our 12/11/2006 open-mic performance. We played two PYC originals, <em>Can't Sleep</em> and <em>Drift</em>.</p>

<p><strong>(12/07/06):</strong> Our recent open-mic stint was captured on moving picture tape, magically converted to digital streaming video. Watch us play rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist Kathy's <em>Analogue</em> and <em>Cyanide</em>.</p>

<p><strong>(12/04/06):</strong> Now playing live at <a href="http://www.lestats.com">Lestat's West</a> on Mondays for open-mic night. Come see us rock out gently between 7pm-11pm (we usually go on about 8-ish).</p>
